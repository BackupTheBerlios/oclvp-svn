2005-12-05  Marcel Kyas  <mkyas@users.berlios.de>

	* tests/testsuite.at: Corrected test names.

	* source/Lexer.ml, source/Lexer.mli: New files.  Split out
	lexicographical analyser; many different parts need it.

	* source/Type.ml, source/Type.mli: New files.  Both OCL and UML
	diagrams depend on types.  In order to make the different parts
	more independent, types have been moved into their own compilation
	unit.

	* source/OCL.ml, source/OCL.mli: Removed parts which have been
	moved to Lexer.ml{,i} and Type.ml{,i}.

	* source/Driver.ml: Renamed XmlWriter to XmlTextWriter.

	* source/XmlWriter.ml, source/XmlTextWriter.ml: Renamed files to
	be more consistent.

	* source/SUML.ml: Build more syntax trees.

	* source/ObjectDiagram.mli:  New file.

	* source/Classifier.mli: Merged into ClassDiagram.mli

	* source/Classifier.ml: Merged into ClassDiagram.mli

	* source/ClassDiagram.mli: New file.

	* source/ClassDiagram.ml: Merged from Classifier.ml.

	* source/Makefile.am: Distribute new files.  Do not distribute
	removed files.

2005-12-02  Marcel Kyas  <mkyas@users.berlios.de>

	* share/suml02.dtd: Boolean attributes only use true or false and
	not yes or no.  Parameters may have a direction now.

	* source/XmlReader.ml, source/XmlTextReader.ml,
	source/Makefile.am: Renamed the module to match the name of the C#
	spec.

	* source/SUML.ml: Extract all attributes defined for a node.

	* source/SUML.mli: Updated documentation.

	* source/Classifier.ml, source/Classifier.mli: Added a definition
	of attribute.

	* source/XMI.ml:  Do not depend on XmlTextReader.

	* source/SUML.ml: Rewrote most parts such that we advance the
	cursor more lazily.  Now the test cases pass, but the parser does
	not yet do anything useful :-(

	* source/XmlReader.ml, source/xmlr_stubs.c: Corrected an error
	where a program could segfault in XmlReader.name; now we raise an
	exception.  Bind xmlTextReaderGetParserLineNumber.

	* oclvp.spec.in: Also update the xml catalog in order to locate
	the suml document type definition.

	here.

	XMI files and set up environment for testing the uninstalled
	project.

	* tests/Makefile.am: Distribute new files.

2005-11-24  Marcel Kyas  <mkyas@users.berlios.de>

	* source/OCL.ml: Corrected an error in the way float literals and
	integer literals are lexed.  Raise Eof if we encounter an
	end-of-file instead of aborting with assert false.  Cleaned up
	some functions.  Removed the interpreter for now.  Handle literals
	differently; they are decoupled from object diagrams now.  Updated
	the pretty printer and the conversion to XML.  Parse message
	expressions.  More error corrections.

	* source/OCL.mli: Updated the abstract syntax in the interface.
	Export the exceptions.

	literals to the valid collections.  Parse type-specifications,
	variable declarations, collection calls, iterate expressions,
	iterator expressions let expressions.

	Correct abstract syntax of type declarations.

	* source/Xslt.ml, source/xslt_stubs.c:  Added more bindings.

	DOM based functions.

	* source/xmld_stubs.c: New file implementing the stubs for Xml.ml.

	* source/xml_helpers.h:  Expose some more macros.

	* source/XMI.ml: Implemented the old style parser using the OCaml
	bindings.

	* source/Makefile.am:  depend now depends on all source files and
	Makefile.am.  As a side-effect, depend will be rebuild more
	eagerly.  Updated generation of Version.ml.  Added xmld_stubs.c
	and Xml.ml to libxml_stubs.a

	calls and association call expressions.  Made the test sets more

	ocamldoc and ocamlweb rules for building the API documentation.

	* configure.ac: Check for libxslt, set the ocaml-related
	directories in a sensible manner.  Define the different compilers
	in terms of ocamlfind.  Smaller corrections if the build tools are
	not found.  Require libxml 2.6.0 or later.

	* testsuite.at: Added tests for context declarations within
	packages.  Added tests for operation call expressions.

	* OCL.ml: Corrected an error in parsing context declarations
	within packages.  Implemented parsing of operation call
	expressions.  Adapted abstract syntax to be able to mark
	OperationCalls @pre.

2005-11-17  Marcel Kyas  <mkyas@users.berlios.de>

	* XmlReader.ml, xmlr_stubs.c: The website at
	<http://neugierig.org/software/ocaml/xmlr/> states, that the
	software is licensed using the LGPL, the accompanying README
	claims that the software is distributed under an MIT License.
	Following clause 3. of the LGPL I distribute the modified copy of
	this code under the terms of the ordinary GPL.
