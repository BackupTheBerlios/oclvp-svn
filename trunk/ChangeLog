	* xslt_stub.c, Xslt.ml:  Very simple binding to libxslt.

	* configure.ac: Check for libxslt, set the ocaml-related
	directories in a sensible manner.

	* testsuite.at: Added tests for context declarations within
	packages.  Added tests for operation call expressions.

	* XmlReader.ml, xmlr_stubs.c: The website at
	<http://neugierig.org/software/ocaml/xmlr/> states, that the
	software is licensed using the LGPL, the accompanying README
	claims that the software is distributed under an MIT License.
	Following clause 3. of the LGPL I distribute the modified copy of
	this code under the terms of the ordinary GPL.

	* xml_helpers.c: Made string_option from xmlr_stubs.c public as
	xml_string_option.

	* XmlWriter.ml, xmlw_stubs.c: Added exceptions if the API claims
	that a call has failed.  Made all instances where we may pass NULL
	in the C-API options in OCaml.

	* OCL.ml: Started to implement writing trees to XML.  Replaced
	the tuples oclcontext and oclpackage by structures.
