	* source/Makefile.am: Distribute Settings.ml

	* source/Driver.ml: Use new module for global settings.

	* source/XMI.ml: Small correction in writing temporary files.

	* source/XmlReader.ml: Updated documentation. Function for
	activating debugging output.

	* source/Xslt.ml: Function for activating debugging output.

	* source/xslt_stubs.c: Debugging output, simplifications, and
	error corrections.

	* source/xmlr_stubs.c, source/xmld_stubs.c: Added more debugging
	output.

	* tests/argouml.xmi, tests/rhapsody.xmi: Added two more test cases
	for the XMI parser.

	* tests/testsuite.at, tests/atlocal.in: Added test cases using the
	XMI files and set up environment for testing the uninstalled
	project.

	* tests/Makefile.am: Distribute new files.

2005-11-24  Marcel Kyas  <mkyas@users.berlios.de>

	* source/OCL.ml: Corrected an error in the way float literals and
	integer literals are lexed.  Raise Eof if we encounter an
	end-of-file instead of aborting with assert false.  Cleaned up
	some functions.  Removed the interpreter for now.  Handle literals
	differently; they are decoupled from object diagrams now.  Updated
	the pretty printer and the conversion to XML.  Parse message
	expressions.  More error corrections.

	* source/OCL.mli: Updated the abstract syntax in the interface.
	Export the exceptions.

	* source/Driver.ml: Updated the functions used for parsing ocl
	files.  Added an option that exports the parsed tree to XML for
	debugging.

	* source/Makefile.am: Don't build the PVS Back End for now.

	* source/xmlw_stubs.c: Added debugging output.

	* source/XmlWriter.ml: Export setting the debug flag.

	* tests/testsuite.at: Added tests for OCL message expressions and
	a test case for the error in lexing integer literals and float
	literals.

2005-11-23  Marcel Kyas  <mkyas@users.berlios.de>

	* source/OCL.ml: Mark end of file by None instead of a token.
	Parse collection property calls and association call expressions.
	Simplify generating XML from trees. Restrict parsing of collection
	literals to the valid collections.  Parse type-specifications,
	variable declarations, collection calls, iterate expressions,
	iterator expressions let expressions.

	* source/OCL.mli: Added a node for association call expressions.
	Correct abstract syntax of type declarations.

	* source/Xslt.ml, source/xslt_stubs.c:  Added more bindings.

	* source/Xml.ml:  New file for libxml2 bindings, containing the
	DOM based functions.

	* source/xmld_stubs.c: New file implementing the stubs for Xml.ml.

	* source/xml_helpers.h:  Expose some more macros.

	* source/XMI.ml: Implemented the old style parser using the OCaml
	bindings.

	* source/Makefile.am:  depend now depends on all source files and
	Makefile.am.  As a side-effect, depend will be rebuild more
	eagerly.  Updated generation of Version.ml.  Added xmld_stubs.c
	and Xml.ml to libxml_stubs.a

	* tests/testsuite.at: Added tests for parsing collection property
	calls and association call expressions.  Made the test sets more
	meaningful and harmonised names.  Added tests for parsing let
	expressions, collection calls, iterate expressions and iterator
	expressions.

2005-11-18  Marcel Kyas  <mkyas@users.berlios.de>

	* data/xmi2suml.xsl:  Added the old style-sheet translating XMI
	1.0 to SUML 0.2.

	* data/Makefile.am: Distribute it.

	* README:  Added build requirements.

	* xslt_stub.c, Xslt.ml:  Very simple binding to libxslt.

	* source/Makefile.am: Correctly install the module for distcheck
	target.  Added a ocamlfind related uninstall hook.  Define the
	different compilers in terms of ocamlfind.  Smaller cleanups.

	* Makefile.am: Delete backup files with make clean.  Added
	ocamldoc and ocamlweb rules for building the API documentation.

	* configure.ac: Check for libxslt, set the ocaml-related
	directories in a sensible manner.  Define the different compilers
	in terms of ocamlfind.  Smaller corrections if the build tools are
	not found.  Require libxml 2.6.0 or later.

	* testsuite.at: Added tests for context declarations within
	packages.  Added tests for operation call expressions.

	* OCL.ml: Corrected an error in parsing context declarations
	within packages.  Implemented parsing of operation call
	expressions.  Adapted abstract syntax to be able to mark
	OperationCalls @pre.

2005-11-17  Marcel Kyas  <mkyas@users.berlios.de>

	* XmlReader.ml, xmlr_stubs.c: The website at
	<http://neugierig.org/software/ocaml/xmlr/> states, that the
	software is licensed using the LGPL, the accompanying README
	claims that the software is distributed under an MIT License.
	Following clause 3. of the LGPL I distribute the modified copy of
	this code under the terms of the ordinary GPL.

	* xml_helpers.c: Made string_option from xmlr_stubs.c public as
	xml_string_option.

	* XmlWriter.ml, xmlw_stubs.c: Added exceptions if the API claims
	that a call has failed.  Made all instances where we may pass NULL
	in the C-API options in OCaml.

	* OCL.ml: Started to implement writing trees to XML.  Replaced
	the tuples oclcontext and oclpackage by structures.
