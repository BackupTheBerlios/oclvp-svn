	* data/xmi2suml.xsl:  Added the old style-sheet translating XMI
	1.0 to SUML 0.2.

	* data/Makefile.am: Distribute it.

	* README:  Added build requirements.

	* xslt_stub.c, Xslt.ml:  Very simple binding to libxslt.

	* source/Makefile.am: Correctly install the module for distcheck
	target.  Added a ocamlfind related uninstall hook.  Define the
	different compilers in terms of ocamlfind.  Smaller cleanups.

	* Makefile.am: Delete backup files with make clean.  Added
	ocamldoc and ocamlweb rules for building the API documentation.

	* configure.ac: Check for libxslt, set the ocaml-related
	directories in a sensible manner.  Define the different compilers
	in terms of ocamlfind.  Smaller corrections if the build tools are
	not found.  Require libxml 2.6.0 or later.

	* testsuite.at: Added tests for context declarations within
	packages.  Added tests for operation call expressions.

	* OCL.ml: Corrected an error in parsing context declarations
	within packages.  Implemented parsing of operation call
	expressions.  Adapted abstract syntax to be able to mark
	OperationCalls @pre.

	* XmlReader.ml, xmlr_stubs.c: The website at
	<http://neugierig.org/software/ocaml/xmlr/> states, that the
	software is licensed using the LGPL, the accompanying README
	claims that the software is distributed under an MIT License.
	Following clause 3. of the LGPL I distribute the modified copy of
	this code under the terms of the ordinary GPL.

	* xml_helpers.c: Made string_option from xmlr_stubs.c public as
	xml_string_option.

	* XmlWriter.ml, xmlw_stubs.c: Added exceptions if the API claims
	that a call has failed.  Made all instances where we may pass NULL
	in the C-API options in OCaml.

	* OCL.ml: Started to implement writing trees to XML.  Replaced
	the tuples oclcontext and oclpackage by structures.
