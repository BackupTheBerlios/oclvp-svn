oclvp - Object Constraint Language Verification Platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

oclvp provides tools which translates a subset of OCL and UML into
the input language of the PVS theorem prover.

Build requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to build oclvp, you need to have ocaml-findlib installed.
Versions prior to 1.1 have problems with uninstalling packages, so
you should use ocaml-findlib version 1.1 or later.

Objective Caml (ocaml) version 3.08 or later
<http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/index.en.html> is needed as a compiler.

In addition, you need libxml2 2.6.x and libxslt 1.1.x (and related tools)
<http://xmlsoft.org/>.  These are usually installed by default on most
Linux distributions; be sure to instal the corresponding development
packages.
